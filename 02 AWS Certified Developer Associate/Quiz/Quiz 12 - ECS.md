5) You are running a web application on ECS, the Docker image is stored on ECR, and trying to launch two containers
   of the same type on EC2. The first container starts, but the second one doesn't. You have checked and there's
   enough CPU and RAM available on the EC2 instance. What's the problem?
    * The EC2 instances has permissions issues with ECR & you must fix the IAM policy
    * The host port is defined in the task definition
    * The container port is definied in the task definition
    * EC2 instances can only run one container instance for each image

    * The ECS agent is not running

      docker pull $ECR_IMAGE_URL
      ````

    * Create 4 EC2 instance roles & attach tehm to the EC2 instances in the ECS cluster
    * Create 1 ECS task role with 4 policies & attach it to each ECS task definition
