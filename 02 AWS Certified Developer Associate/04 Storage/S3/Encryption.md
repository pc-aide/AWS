# Encryption

## Acronym
* S3 - Simple Storage Service
* KMS - Key Management Service
* SSE - Server Side Encryption
* SSL - Secure Sockets Layers
* TLS - Transport Layer Security

## Doc

## Introduction
* There are 4 mehtods of encrypting objects in S3
    * SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    * SSE-KMS: leverage AWS KMS to manage encryption keys
    * SSE-C: when you want ot manage your own encryption keys
    * Client Side Encryption

## SSE-S3
* SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3
* Object is encrypted **server side**
* AES-256 encryption type
* Must set header: **"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"**

## SSE-KMS
* SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
* KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
* Object is encrypted server side
* Must set header: **"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"**

## SSE-C
* SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
* Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
* **HTTPS must be used**
* Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

## Client Side Encryption
* Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption client
* Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
* Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
* Customer fully manages the keys & encryption cycle

## Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
* Amazon S3 exposes:
    * HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
    * HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
* Most clients would use the HTTPS endpoint by default
* HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
* Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS
