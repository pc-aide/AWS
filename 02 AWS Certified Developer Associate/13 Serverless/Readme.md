## What's serverless?
* Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore...
* They just deploy **code**
* They just deploy... **functions**
* Initially... Serverless == FaaS
* Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc"
* **Serverless does not mean there are no servers...**
    * it means you just don't manage/provision/see them
