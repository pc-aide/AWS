As a Developer, you have been roped in to help him in this process.<br/>Which of the following will you suggest?
      * A. Create an export configuration from the EB console from Team A's account. This configuration has to be shared with the IAM Role of Team B's account. The import option of Team's account will hsow the saved configuration, that can be used to create a new Beanstalk application
