55) A .NET developer team works with many ASP.NET web applications that use EC2 instances to host them on IIS. The deployment process needs to be configured so that multiple versions of the application can run in AWS Elastic Beanstalk. One version would be used for development, testing, and another version for load testing.<br/>Which of the following methods do you recommend?
    * A. Create an ALB to route based on hostname so you can pass on parameters to the development EB envrironment. Create a file in .ebextensions/ to know how to handle the traffic coming from the ALB
    * B. You can't have multiple development environmentss in EB, just one development & one production environment
    * C. Define a dev environment with a single instance & a 'load test' environment that has settings close to production environment
    * D. Use only one Beanstalk environment & perform configuration changes using an Ansible script
56) Your AWS CodeDeploy deployment to T2 instances succeed. The new application revision makes API calls to Amazon S3 however the application is not working as expected due to authorization exceptions and you were assigned to troubleshoot the issue.<br/>Which of the following should you do?
    * A. Fix the IAM permissions for the CodeDeploy service role
    * B. Enable CodeDeploy Proxy
    * C. Fix the IAM permissions for the EC2 instance role
    * D. Make the S3 bucket public
57) You are revising options that would be best for monitoring a few EC2 instances you currently manage. Amazon CloudWatch has metrics available to monitor your EC2 instances for CPU load, I/O, and network I/O. Your budget does not allow for spending on monitoring so using the default monitoring available is your preferred choice.<br/>With default monitoring, at what interval will these metrics be collected?
    * A. 2 minutes
    * B. 1 minute
    * C. 10 minutes
    * D. 5 minutes
58) You have an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream with 10 shards, and from the metrics, you are well below the throughput utilization of 10 MB per second to send data. You send 3 MB per second of data and yet you are receiving ProvisionedThroughputExceededException errors frequently.<br/>What is the likely cause of this?
    * A. You have too many shards
    * B. The partition key that you have selected isn't distributed enough
    * C. The data retention period is too long
    * D. Metrics are slow to update
59) Your company has a load balancer in a VPC configured to be internet facing. The public DNS name assigned to the load balancer is `myDns-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`. When your client applications first load they capture the load balancer DNS name and then resolve the IP address for the load balancer so that they can directly reference the underlying IP.<br/>It is observed that the client applications work well but unexpectedly stop working after a while. What is the reason for this?
    * A. Your SGs are not stable
    * B. You need to disable multi-AZ deployments
    * C. You need to enable stickiness
    * D. The LB is higly available & its public IP may change. The DNS name is constant
60) An IT company uses a blue/green deployment policy to provision new Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind a new Application Load Balancer for each new application version. The current set up requires the users to log in after every new deployment.<br/>As a Developer Associate, what advice would you give to the company for resolving this issue?
    * A. Use multicast to replicate session information
    * B. Use rolling updates instead of a blue/green deployment
    * C. Use ElastiCache to maintain user sessions
    * D. Enable sticky sessions in the ALB
61) After reviewing your monthly AWS bill you notice that the cost of using Amazon SQS has gone up substantially after creating new queues; however, you know that your queue clients do not have a lot of traffic and are receiving empty responses.<br/>Which of the following actions should you take?
    * A. Use LongPolling
    * B. Use a FIFO queue
    * C. Increase the VisibilityTimeout
    * D. Decrease DelaySeconds
62) You are working for a technology startup building web and mobile applications. You would like to pull Docker images from the ECR repository called demo so you can start running local tests against the latest application version.<br/>Which of the following commands must you run to pull existing Docker images from ECR? (**Select two**)
    * A. `$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email`
    * B. `dokcer build -t 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest`
    * C. `dokcer pull 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest`
    * D. `aws docker push 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest`
    * E. `docker login -u $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_IP -p $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_key1
63) You're a developer maintaining a web application written in .NET. The application makes references to public objects in a public S3 accessible bucket using a public URL. While doing a code review your colleague advises that the approach is not a best practice because some of the objects contain private data. After the administrator makes the S3 bucket private you can no longer access the S3 objects but you would like to create an application that will enable people to access some objects as needed with a time policy constraint.<br/>Which of the following options will give access to the objects?
    * A. Using IAM policy
    * B. Using pre-signed URL
    * C. Using Routing Policy
    * D. Using bucket policy
64) You are a manager for a tech company that has just hired a team of developers to work on the company's AWS infrastructure.

Encoded authorization failure message: 6h34GtpmGjJJUm946eDVBfzWQJk6z5GePbbGDs9Z2T8xZj9EZtEduSnTbmrR7pMqpJrVYJCew2m8YBZQf4HRWEtrpncANrZMsnzk.<br/>Which of the following actions will help developers decode the message?
    * A. AWS IAM decode-authorization-message
    * B. Use KMS decode-authorization-message
    * C. AWS Cognito Decoder
    * D. AWS STS decode-authorization-message
65) A voting system hosted on-premise was recently migrated to AWS to lower cost, gain scalability, and to better serve thousands of concurrent users. When one of the AWS resource state changes, it generates an event and will need to trigger AWS Lambda. The AWS resource whose state changes and AWS Lambda does not have direct integration.<br/>Which of the following methods can be used to trigger AWS Lambda?
    * A. AWS Lambda Custom Sources
    * B. Open a support ticket with AWS
    * C. CloudWatch Events Rules with AWS Lambda
    * D. Cron jobs to trigger AWS Lambda to check the state of your service
