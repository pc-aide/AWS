# Cost Allocation Tags

## Intro
* With Tags we can track resources that relate to each other
* With Cost Allocation Tags we can enable detailed costing reports
* Just like tags, but they show up as columns in **Reports**
1) AWS Generated Cost Allocation Tags
  * Automatically applied to the resource you create
  * Starts with Prefix **AWS:** (e.g. AWS:createBy)
  * They're not applied to resources created before the activation
2) User tags
  * Defined by the user
  * Starts with Prefix **user:**
* Cost Allocation Tags just appear in the Billing Console
* Takes up to 24 hours for the tags to show up in the report
