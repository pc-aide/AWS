# CI/CD

## Acronym
* CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Development

## Intro
* Developers push the code to a code repository often (GitHub/CodeCommit/Bitbucket/etc...)
* A testing/build server checks the code as soon as it's pushed (CodeBuild/Jenkins CI/etc...)
* The developer fets feedback about the test & checks that have passed/failed
* Find bugs early,fix bugs
* Deliver faster as the code is tested
* Deploy often
* happier developers, as thy're unblocked

* Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed
* Ensure deplyments happen often & are quick
* Shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day"
* That usually means automated deployment
  * CodeDeploy
  * Jenkins CD
  * Spinnaker
